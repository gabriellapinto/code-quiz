# code-quiz

## About This Project:
The objective for this project was to create a quiz with code related questions using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Some of the requirements for this project were to include a timer, a right/wrong answer boolean, a link to the high scores page, and to grab user data to display the user's score and for them to add their initials to the score board. All of these components were mainly made with JavaScript and were created by using functions, localStorage, if statements, and DOM manipulation.
